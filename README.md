# Telecom_Churn_CaseStudy_ML_2
In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. As a data scientist, your task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data. This case study is slightly different from the other assignments and case studies that you would have attempted in the previous modules. This time around, we are offering this case study in the form of a Kaggle competition. Kaggle is an online community for data scientists offering ML competitions, data sets, notebooks, and micro-courses. Kaggle competitions are quite popular among top data science enthusiasts and recruiters, and therefore, they will become an indispensable part of your data science learning and career path. First, you will learn about Kaggle, its features, how to operate the interface, the various services it offers, and most importantly about its competitions. After this, you will attempt a competition based on the churn prediction problem on the Kaggle platform.
